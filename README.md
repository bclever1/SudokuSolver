My bad ass sudoku solver

Please download the .exe and .dll into the same folder.

This project is not meant to be the fastest solver in the world. It will get faster as I 
add more solving techniques (which means less guessing), nor is it the prettiest (yet). 
I used this project to highlight the following subjects:

1) Linking a C# graphical interface to a C++ code engine (DLL).
2) Modern C++ including:
   a) threads
   b) thread-safe singletons and classes (my design!) in C# and C++
   c) templates
   d) shared_ptrs and unique_ptrs and data structures of such beasts
   e) memory management
   f) functors (function classes)
   g) finite state machines in both C# and C++
   h) STL containers
3) Algorithmic sudoku solving techniques.
4) Advanced debugging in VS2017
5) GitHub
