My sudoku solver...

Please download SudokuSolver.zip and extract anywhere.

This project is not meant to be the fastest solver in the world, nor is it the prettiest. 
It will get faster as I add more solving techniques (which means less guessing)  
and it will get prettier when I have time. 

I used this project to highlight the following subjects:

1) Linking a C# graphical interface to a C++ code engine (DLL).
2) Modern C++ including:
   a) threads
   b) thread-safe singletons and classes (my design!) in C# and C++
   c) templates
   d) shared_ptrs and unique_ptrs and data structures of such beasts
   e) memory management
   f) functors (function classes)
   g) finite state machines in both C# and C++
   h) STL containers
3) Algorithmic sudoku solving techniques.
4) Advanced debugging in VS2017
5) GitHub
